
Building:

  To build the driver assembly, run 'msbuild' in the 'Driver' directory.  This
  will compile Driver.cs into Salsa.dll, embed it as an unpacked byte string in
  Driver.hs, and then copy it into the Foreign\Salsa directory.

  You can also build the driver by hand:

csc -filealign:512 -optimize+ -out:Salsa.dll -target:library Driver.cs

  Or if mono:

gmcs -filealign:512 -optimize+ -out:Salsa.dll -target:library Driver.cs

  Followed by:

runhaskell Embed Salsa.dll > ../Foreign/Salsa/Driver.hs

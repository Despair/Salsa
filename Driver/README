
Building:
  To build the driver assembly, just run 'msbuild' in the 'Driver' directory.
  This will compile Driver.cs into Salsa.dll, embed it as an unpacked byte
  string in Driver.hs, and then copy it into the Foreign\Salsa directory.

  (MSBuild is part of the .NET Framework and can be found in:
  '%WINDIR%\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50272')

Building by hand:

  csc -filealign:512 -optimize+ -out:Salsa.dll -target:library Driver.cs
  runhaskell Embed Salsa.dll > ../Salsa/Driver.hs

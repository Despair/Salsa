Salsa: a .NET bridge for Haskell
--------------------------------

Foreign\Salsa: the Foreign.Salsa library.

  Exposes the Haskell-side interface to Salsa, including: functions to load the
  .NET runtime into the process, functions for interactive with .NET classes
  and objects, and the required type-level machinery.

Driver: the Salsa .NET driver assembly (Salsa.dll).

  Contains the .NET code that is loaded by the Salsa library to call in and out
  of the .NET runtime.  The assembly binary (Salsa.dll) is embedded in
  Foreign\Salsa\Driver.hs with Embed.hs.

Generator: the Salsa binding generator.

  A C# program that generates Haskell files from .NET metadata to provide
  type-safe access to the requested .NET classes and methods in .NET
  assembilies.
  
  Note: this requires .NET 3.5 because it uses the System.Linq namespace.

Samples\

  Hello      - Hello World sample (requires .NET 2.0 or later).

  Conway     - Simulator for Conway's Game of Life.  Uses the Windows
               Presentation Foundation library in .NET 3.0 for the GUI
               (requires .NET 3.0 or later).
